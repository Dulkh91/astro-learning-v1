Using TypeScript in a Next.js project offers several key benefits that improve code quality, developer experience, and maintainability.


**Type Safety**: Catches errors early, ensures consistent data types across components and API routes.


**Developer Experience**: Offers autocompletion, refactoring tools, and real-time error feedback in editors like VS Code.


**Maintainability**: Clear type definitions make code easier to read, debug, and scale in large applications.
