tag: ["next"]
---
Next.js offers two primary routing systems: the Pages Router and the App Router. The key differences between them lie in their approach to routing, data fetching, and component rendering:


### Key Differences
**Directory structure**
* Pages Router: pages/
* App Router: app/
**Route**
* Pages Router: File-based ([param].js)
* App Router: Folder-based ([param]/page.js)
**layout**
* Pages Router: _app.js, _document.js
* App Router: layout.js with nested layout support
**Data fetching**
* Pages Router: getStaticProps, getServerSideProps
* App Router: async/await directly in Server Components
