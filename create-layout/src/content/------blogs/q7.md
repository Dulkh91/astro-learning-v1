React Server Components (RSCs) are a feature in React that allows certain components to be rendered exclusively on the server, rather than on the client (browser).

**Benefits:**

- **Direct Data Fetching:** Query databases/APIs directly in components without useEffect
- **Smaller Bundle Size:** Server code never sent to client = faster page loads
- **Enhanced Security:** API keys and sensitive data stay on server
- **Better SEO:** Fully rendered HTML improves search indexing
- **Improved Performance:** Faster initial page loads with pre-rendered content
