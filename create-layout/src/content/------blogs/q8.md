tag: ['next']

Client Components and Server Components work together to create a single application. **Server Components handle the non-interactive, data-heavy parts** of the UI, fetching data and rendering the initial HTML on the server. **Client Components handle the interactive parts**, such as state management and user events, and run in the browser.


*   **Use Server Components for:**
    
    *   **Data Fetching:** Direct database or API calls.
        
    *   **Static Content:** UI that doesn't change with user interaction, like a blog post.
        
    *   **Reducing JavaScript:** Keeping your client-side bundle size small.
        
*   **Use Client Components for:**
    
    *   **Interactivity:** Handling clicks, forms, and other user events.
        
    *   **Browser APIs:** Accessing things like localStorage or geolocation.
        
    *   **State:** When you need to use hooks like useState or useEffect.
