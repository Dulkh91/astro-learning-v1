Tthe benefits of using TypeScript:

**Early Error Detection:** Catches type-related errors during development (compile-time) rather than runtime, leading to more robust applications.
    
**Improved Code Readability and Maintainability:** Explicit types make code easier to understand and refactor, especially in large codebases or team environments.
    
**Enhanced Developer Experience:** Provides excellent autocompletion, IntelliSense, and refactoring tools in IDEs like VS Code, increasing productivity.
    

**Better Collaboration:** Clear contracts defined by types help developers understand how different parts of the application interact.
