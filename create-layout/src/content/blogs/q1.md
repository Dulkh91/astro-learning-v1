title: "What is the process to migrate a React application from JavaScript to TypeScript? What files or syntax changes typically occur?"
---

### **1\. Initial Setup**

Install TypeScript and the necessary type definitions, then create a tsconfig.json file to configure the compiler.

### **2\. File and Syntax Changes**

Rename your .js and .jsx files to **.ts** and **.tsx**. Then, add **type annotations** to your code for props, state, and function parameters. This replaces older validation methods like PropTypes.

### **3\. Gradual Migration**

The best practice is to convert files one by one. The TypeScript compiler is built to work alongside existing JavaScript files, making the transition an incremental process.
