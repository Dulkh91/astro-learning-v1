The advantages of TypeScript in Next.js:

*   **Catch Errors at Compile Time**: TypeScript allows developers to catch type-related errors during compilation, which means issues are identified before the code even runs, reducing runtime errors.
    
*   **Better Developer Experience**: With TypeScript, you get enhanced features like IntelliSense and autocomplete in your IDE, making coding more efficient and less error-prone.
    
*   **Safer Refactoring and Maintainable Code**: TypeScript's static typing makes refactoring safer because changes in one part of the codebase are less likely to break other parts unexpectedly. This leads to more maintainable code over time.
