To migrate a React app from JavaScript to TypeScript, you must **install TypeScript** and its type definitions, **create a tsconfig.json file** to configure the compiler, and then **rename your .js/.jsx files to .ts/.tsx**. After that, the main work is to **add type annotations** to your code, such as for component props and state, and **fix any type errors** that the compiler reports.

#### **Key Changes**

*   **Files:** Rename .js and .jsx files to **.ts** and **.tsx**.
    
*   **Syntax:**
    
    *   **Props:** Use interface or type to define prop shapes instead of prop-types.
        
    *   **State:** Explicitly type state variables using hooks like useState(0).
