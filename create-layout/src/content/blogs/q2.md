The process to migrate a React application from JavaScript to TypeScript

1\. **Rename Files:** Change all .js and .jsx files to .ts and .tsx respectively. This tells TypeScript to compile these files.

2\. **Install Dependencies:** You need to install TypeScript and type definitions for React. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
```

3\. **Create tsconfig.json:** This file configures how TypeScript compiles your code. You can start with a basic configuration or use **tsc --init** to generate one.

4\. **Fix Type Errors:** TypeScript will now catch errors. You'll need to:

* Define interfaces or types for props.
* Add type annotations to variables, function parameters, and return types.
* Use TypeScript's type inference where possible to reduce manual typing.
