In a React project, **tsconfig.json** is a configuration file for the **TypeScript compiler**. It tells the compiler how to transform your TypeScript code (.ts and .tsx files) into standard JavaScript that browsers and Node.js can understand.
### **Role in TypeScript Development**

tsconfig.json acts as the central control panel for your TypeScript project, ensuring consistency and correctness across your codebase. Its main roles are:

*   **Compiler Options:** It specifies key settings for the compiler, such as the target JavaScript version (e.g., "esnext"), how to handle JSX syntax ("react-jsx"), and the module system to use. These options ensure your code is compiled for the correct environment.
    
*   **File Management:** It defines which files the compiler should **include** (like your src folder) and **exclude** (like node\_modules). This helps speed up the compilation process and prevents errors from third-party libraries.
    

**Enforcing Type Safety:** The file enforces strict type-checking rules. For example, the "strict": true setting enables a suite of checks that catch potential bugs early in development, helping you write more robust and reliable code.
