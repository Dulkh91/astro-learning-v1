Three key configurations commonly found in a tsconfig.json file for optimizing a React app:

**1\. jsx: "react-jsx"** 
* Enables the modern JSX transform for React 17+, removing the need to import React in every file and improving build performance.

**2\. strict:** 
* true Activates all strict type-checking options, helping catch bugs early and enforce safer, more predictable code throughout your React components.

**2\.moduleResolution:**
* "node" Ensures TypeScript resolves modules the same way Node.js does, which is essential for importing packages and components correctly in a React project.
