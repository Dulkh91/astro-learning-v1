### **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) 💻**

Instead of sending an empty HTML file and letting the browser render the content, Next.js generates the complete HTML on the server for each request. This means users see content immediately, leading to a much faster perceived loading time and better user experience.

### **Static Site Generation (SSG) 🚀**

This allows you to pre-render pages into static HTML at build time. When a user requests a static page, the pre-built HTML is delivered instantly from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This is extremely fast and secure, making it ideal for blogs, marketing sites, or any content that doesn't change frequently.

### **File-System Routing 📁**

to manually configure routes. Simply create a file in the pages directory, and it automatically becomes a route. 

**API Routes 🔗**

Next.js allows you to create **API endpoints** directly within your application. By creating a file inside the pages/api directory, you can build a serverless API that runs alongside your front-end code. This is perfect for handling form submissions, fetching data, or performing server-side logic without needing a separate backend server.

### **Automatic Code Splitting ✂️**

Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller chunks. When a user navigates to a new page, only the necessary code for that page is loaded. This reduces the initial load time and ensures your application remains fast, even as it grows.

### **TypeScript Support ⌨️**

Next.js has excellent **built-in TypeScript support**. It provides a seamless setup and powerful type-checking to help you catch errors early and build more robust, scalable applications.
