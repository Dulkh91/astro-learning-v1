title: "What is the difference between App Router and Pages Router in Next.js?"
tag: ["next"]
---

**App Router** is Next.js's modern approach to routing, designed around **React Server Components**. It defaults to rendering components on the server for better performance. The routing is based on folders, where a page.js file inside a folder defines a new route. This router also introduces flexible, nested layouts.

**Pages Router** is the original routing system in Next.js. It's built around a file-based system where a file in the pages/ directory directly corresponds to a route. Components in this router are **Client Components** by default, meaning they render on the client-side.
