#### Key Benefits of Using Next.js

**1\.  Hybrid Rendering (SSR + SSG + ISR)** 

* Next.js supports **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, and **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**—giving you flexibility to optimize performance and SEO based on your content needs.
    
**2\.  Built-in Routing System** 

* No need for external libraries like React Router. Just create files in the `pages/` directory, and Next.js automatically sets up the routes—simple and intuitive.
    
**3\.  Automatic Code Splitting** 

* Next.js splits your code by page, so users only load what they need. This improves load times and performance without manual configuration.
    
**4\.  API Routes** 

* Can build backend functionality directly inside your Next.js app using `pages/api/`. It’s perfect for handling form submissions, authentication, or lightweight server logic.
    
**5\.  Optimized Image Handling** 

* The `next/image` component provides automatic image optimization—lazy loading, resizing, and format conversion—boosting performance and user experience.
    
**6\. Fast Refresh & Developer Experience** 

* With hot reloading, TypeScript support, and great error overlays, Next.js makes development smooth and efficient.
