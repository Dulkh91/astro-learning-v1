#### Difference Between App Router and Pages Router in Next.js

**1\. File Structure & Routing**

*   **Pages Router**: Uses the pages/ directory. Each file automatically becomes a route.
    
*   **App Router**: Uses the app/ directory. Routing is based on nested folders and layouts.
    

**2\. Component Type Support**

*   **Pages Router**: Only supports **Client Components**.
    
*   **App Router**: Supports both **Server Components** and **Client Components**, allowing better performance and reduced JavaScript on the client.
    

**3\. Layouts and Nested Routing**

*   **Pages Router**: No built-in layout system; layouts must be manually reused.
    
*   **App Router**: Introduces **nested layouts** and **shared UI**, making complex routing easier to manage.
    

**4\. Data Fetching**

*   **Pages Router**: Uses getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, and getInitialProps.
    
*   **App Router**: Uses **async Server Components** and fetch() directly inside components—no special data-fetching functions needed.
    

**5\. Flexibility and Modern Features**

*   **App Router**: Designed for React 18 features like streaming, suspense, and improved performance.
    
*   **Pages Router**: More traditional, stable, and widely adopted—but less flexible for newer patterns.
