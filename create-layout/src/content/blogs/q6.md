### **Advantages** 

**Better Performance** 🚀: Since they render on the server, the browser receives static HTML immediately. This improves the initial page load time and perceived performance for users.

**Less JavaScript** ✂️: Server Components do not get sent to the browser as JavaScript, which reduces the overall bundle size. This is particularly useful for applications with a lot of complex UI logic.

**Direct Server Access** 💾: They can directly interact with server-side resources like databases or file systems without needing to create a separate API endpoint. This simplifies data fetching and reduces architectural complexity.
