title: "6. What is the difference between App Router and Pages Router in Next.js?"
tag: ["next"]
---

*   **App Router**: Introduced in Next.js 13, it uses the app directory for routing, supports server components, and provides more flexibility with nested layouts, error boundaries, and loading states.
    
*   **Pages Router**: Uses the pages directory for routing, simpler but less flexible, doesn't natively support server components, and uses file-based routing for page creation.
