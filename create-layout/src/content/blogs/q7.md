React Client Components complement Server Components by handling interactivity and client-side logic, while Server Components focus on data fetching and server-side rendering.

**Server Components**For non-interactive parts of your UI, such as static content, data fetching, or database access. They're great for improving initial load times and reducing client-side JavaScript.

**Client Components**For any part of your UI that requires interactivity, like state management, event listeners, or browser APIs (e.g., a search bar, a toggle button, or a form).
