Server Components in React:

*   **Server Components**: These are React components that are rendered on the server rather than in the browser. This means the server does the initial rendering, and only the necessary HTML is sent to the client.
    
*   **Advantages**: The primary benefits include a smaller bundle size because less JavaScript needs to be sent to the client, leading to faster initial load times. This approach reduces the amount of JavaScript the browser needs to execute, improving performance, especially on devices with limited processing power.
