React Server Components (RSCs) are a feature in React that allows certain components to be rendered exclusively on the server, sending only the resulting HTML to the client.


#### **Advantages of using them:** 


**Better Performance** : Since they render on the server, the browser receives static HTML immediately. This improves the initial page load time and perceived performance for users.


**Less JavaScript** : Server Components do not get sent to the browser as JavaScript, which reduces the overall bundle size. This is particularly useful for applications with a lot of complex UI logic.


**Direct Server Access** : They can directly interact with server-side resources like databases or file systems without needing to create a separate API endpoint. This simplifies data fetching and reduces architectural complexity.
