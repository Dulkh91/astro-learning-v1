**Hydration** is the process where React takes the static HTML rendered on the server and makes it interactive on the client-side. Itâ€™s how React "wakes up" the pre-rendered page.

### **The Process**

1.  **Server Renders HTML:** The server sends a fully formed HTML page to the browser.
    
2.  **Browser Displays HTML:** The user sees the content immediately, but it's not yet interactive.
    
3.  **React Loads:** The browser downloads the React JavaScript.
    
4.  **React Hydrates:** React traverses the existing HTML, attaches event handlers, and brings the components to life without re-creating the DOM from scratch.
    

### **The Benefit**

This process improves performance and user experience by allowing the user to see content instantly while the application becomes interactive in the background.
