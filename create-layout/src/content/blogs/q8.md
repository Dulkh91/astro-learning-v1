Client Components in React:

*   **Client Components**: These components run in the browser, allowing them to manage state, use effects, and handle events directly. They are ideal for parts of your application that require user interaction.
    
*   **Usage with Server Components**: You would use Server Components for tasks like data fetching and initial rendering, which are server-side operations. Then, Client Components take over for the interactive parts, enhancing the user experience by handling client-side logic.
