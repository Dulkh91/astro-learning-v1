*   **Hydration**: This is the process where React takes the static HTML rendered by the server and makes it interactive in the browser. During hydration, React attaches event listeners to the DOM elements, turning the static content into a dynamic, interactive application. This step is crucial for server-rendered applications to ensure that the client-side React can take over and manage the state and interactions.
