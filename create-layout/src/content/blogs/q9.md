### Hydration in React Client Components

Hydration is the process where React takes server-rendered HTML and attaches event listeners and dynamic behavior to it on the client side. This makes the static HTML interactive.

In the context of **React Client Components**, hydration happens after the initial HTML is delivered by the server. React then loads the JavaScript for Client Components and "hydrates" them—meaning it connects the pre-rendered markup with React’s internal state and event handlers.

This allows users to interact with buttons, forms, and other dynamic elements without needing a full page reload.
